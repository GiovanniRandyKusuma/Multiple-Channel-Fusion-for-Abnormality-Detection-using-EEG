# Multiple Channel Fusion for Abnormality Detection using EEG by Giovanni Randy Kusuma
Paper Created as a Final Year dissertation Project titled "MULTIPLE CHANNEL FUSION FOR ABNORMALITY DETECTION USING EEG" 2023. This paper also examines the effects of preprocessing the EEG signals using PrepPipeline. Please read the paper for more details about the implementation.

## Requirements
Paper built using PyTorch and MatLab for preprocessing the EEG signal. The TUH dataset is being used.
Braindecode library and PrepPipeline is also being use as a helper tool.
##

## Run
1. Open `EEG Line Noise Removal` and read the README.md if you wish to do the line noise removal
2. Modify config.py, especially correct data folders for the dataset and the format use.
4. Run the `diagnosis.py` to train the model
5. Run `plot.py` to plot the results
